# Image-Captioning
Image Captioning using Neural Networks
Automatically generating textual description from an artificial system given any image is the task of image captioning. Image captioning requires to recognize the important objects, their attributes and their relationships in an image. It also needs to generate syntactically and semantically correct sentences. Deep learning-based techniques are capable of handling the complexities and challenges of image captioning. In this project, we aim to present a comprehensive review of one of the best-performing existing deep learning-based image captioning technique using an encoder decoder architecture using CNNs and LSTMs. We discuss the foundation of this technique to analyze its performances, strengths and limitations. We also discuss in detail the preprocessing, modeling and the evaluation pipeline used in this deep learning based automatic image captioning solution.
